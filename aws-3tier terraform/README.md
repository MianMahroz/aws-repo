#### Modular Structure: 
The Terraform code is organized into logical modules (networking, compute, database, bastion) for better maintainability.

#### Dynamic Availability Zones: 
Uses data.aws_availability_zones to automatically fetch available AZs.

#### Count Parameters: 
Uses count to create multiple subnets, NAT gateways, etc., reducing repetitive code.

#### Latest Launch Template Version: 
Uses $Latest for launch template versions in ASGs.

#### Output Variables: 
Each module exposes relevant outputs for other modules to consume.

#### Variable Files: 
Each module has its own variables.tf for clear input requirements.

#### Simplified Security Groups: 
Combined ingress/egress rules where possible.

### To use this Terraform configuration:

- Run terraform init to initialize the modules

- Run terraform plan to review changes

- Run terraform apply to create the infrastructure

### Note: 
You may need to adjust the AMI ID and key pair name based on your AWS region and existing resources.
